# Tutorial Pyspark with Python.

PySpark is the Python API for Apache Spark. It allows you to perform large-scale, real-time data processing in a distributed environment using Python. It also provides a PySpark shell to analyse your data interactively.

In this repository we will develop an ETL process to use pyspark locally on a jupyter notebook.
